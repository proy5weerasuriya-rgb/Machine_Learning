# Preperation Idea
I Trained AI in three different Classes

## 📊 Classes

The model is trained to recognize the following classes:

* **[Class 1 Bottle ]**: Identifies the bottle while i showing it to the webcam.
* **[Class 2 Book]**: Identifies the book while i shwoing it to the webcam.
* **[Class 3 Blank]**: 3rd Class for no objects are present.

## Tools Used 
**Machine Learning** : To gather data and train the AI
**GitHub** : To host the machine learning document and share this project in the word file.


  ## Reflection
  A custom image classification model trained using [Google Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). This model can recognize and classify **[mention what it detects, e.g., three different hand gestures]** in real-time using a webcam.

  ## 🚀 Model Link

You can view and test the live model here:

## 🛠️ How to Use This Model

### 1. In a Web Project (p5.js / JavaScript)

You can integrate this model into your own website using TensorFlow.js.

```javascript
// Replace this with your model URL from the export panel
const URL = "https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/models/vrE169A8O/";

let model, webcam, labelContainer, maxPredictions;

## 📈 Training Details

* **Base Model**: MobileNet
* **Input Type**: Image / Webcam
* **Format**: TensorFlow.js / Keras

## 📝 License

This project is open-source. Feel free to use the model for your own creative experiments!
